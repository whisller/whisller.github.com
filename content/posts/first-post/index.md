Every, well respected, tech blog has to have "First post". Place where you can check if plugin for syntax is working as expected, peaking of which: `print("Hello World")`
It does work, at least on my machine.

This website/blog/diary is not an exception, it also starts with "First post". During years when I was working professionally as developer/team lead, I tried few times to start project like this one.
But always something else took higher priority.

We shall see what future will bring for this blog. 

Shall we start?

This blog was built with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [nunocoracao/blowfish](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish) template.
