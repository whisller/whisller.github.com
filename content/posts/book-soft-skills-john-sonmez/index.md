As you might have noticed by the title, *Soft Skills* by John Z. Sonmez is not a typical book for developers.

But is it?

Even though this book doesnâ€™t talk about technical aspects like the structure of your code,  
programming languages (though .NET is mentioned a few times), or what cloud (or no-cloud) provider you should use â€“ over its 500+ pages, John dives into a wide range of topics you might be surprised to find in a book dedicated to developers.

Some parts resonated more than others, as you'd expect from a book covering so much ground. Donâ€™t treat it as a "silver bullet" that will solve all your problems or answer all your questions.  
Rather, think of it as a book that gives you **alternative perspectives** on many challenges you face daily.

### What stood out most to me?

The first four chapters: **Career**, **Marketing Yourself**, **Learning**, and **Productivity**.

> *Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value.*  
> â€” Albert Einstein

The **Finance** section? Way too focused on real estate. But hey â€” it seems like thatâ€™s *the* silver bullet for many.  
Just buy a few blocks of houses and your passive income is sorted, right? ðŸ˜‰

But as I said: donâ€™t take everything as gospel. Use your brain, and evaluate each idea for yourself.

### Would I recommend it?

Itâ€™s always good to read a new perspective. Parts of this book can bring real value â€” especially  
if youâ€™re at the beginning of your career.
