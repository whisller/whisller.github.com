People rather do not like to write documentation, or if they do it's often either detached from source code, which leads to it being outdated quickly.

It's general problem that I've noticed on majority of close sourced codes I had a chance to work with. I can only hope that I was the unlucky one and your case is different :)

There is multiple strategies and tools you can use to improve docs coverage of your repositories.

This never ending journey of improving the way code is documented lead me to "Docs Like Code" by Anne Gentle.

I will not get into what I was expecting from this book, will just focus on what I really got.

First I was slightly lost on what the target audience of this book is. Are those developers, managers, dedicated docs teams?

Which then leads me to second point. If the book does not have clear audience it's directed to, then it tries to touch everything and nothing.

That's what I feel it was done here, with definitely bigger shift towards non-technical people. Mainly those that never before used Github, or had a chance to work with any of the static page generators. 

Book focus a lot on Github and Git, to the level where it explains basic Github (protected branches, pull requests) and Git (git flow, basic commands) features.

If you have even small experience with Github, Git and static page generators I don't think you will find here anything. 
If you don't have experience with those tools then I believe you will find better tutorials on the web that explains those.

For anyone who wants to increase their knowledge of building docs close to sourcecode this position will be rather disappointment.
