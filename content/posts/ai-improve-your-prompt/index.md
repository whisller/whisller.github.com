Either you have prompt that was built based on some template or you have built it from scratch, sooner or later you will need to improve it.

So every time you use it produces better output for your recurring tasks.

## Using AI to improve your prompt
What worked for me is to iteratively improve the prompt based on the steps required to complete the task.

We can use AI to do that!

After each iteration, you can use this prompt to improve your prompt :)

```
Improve my original prompt (located in ./path/to/prompt) based on what we learned during this conversation. Add necessary context and constraints so you can work more independently next time.
```

## The End
That's it! If your company needs help with introducing AI, [get in touch]({{< ref "/contact" >}} "Get in touch").
